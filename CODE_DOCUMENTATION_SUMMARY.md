## üéì Educational Documentation Features

### Inline Comment Types Used:

#### 1. **Definition Comments** (What)
```python
def validate_income_data(...):
    """Validates income data before saving to database."""
```

#### 2. **Reasoning Comments** (Why)
```python
# Prevent database bloat and potential DoS attacks
if len(description) > 500:
    return False, "Description too long..."
```

#### 3. **Educational Comments** (How/Learning)
```python
"""
INPUT VALIDATION EXPLAINED:
We validate BEFORE touching the database to prevent bad data.
This is called "defensive programming" - assume all input is malicious.
"""
```

#### 4. **Example Comments**
```python
# List comprehension: Extract display_name from each enum member
# Result: ['Salary', 'Freelance', 'Business', ...]
valid_sources = [source.display_name for source in IncomeSource]
```

#### 5. **Concept Explanations**
```python
# strptime = "string parse time" - converts string to datetime object
datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d')
```

## üîç Code Reading Guide for Jr Devs

### Start Here:
1. **Read `requirements.txt`** - Understand dependencies
2. **Read `models.py`** - Understand data structures
3. **Read `database.py`** - Understand data persistence
4. **Read `app.py`** - Understand request handling
5. **Pick a feature** - Trace code from route to database

### Example Flow to Study:
**Adding an Expense:**
```
1. User visits /add (GET)
   ‚Üí app.py line 380 (add_expense function)
   ‚Üí Returns add_expense.html template

2. User submits form (POST)
   ‚Üí app.py line 401 (POST handler)
   ‚Üí Validates: models.py line 947 (validate_expense_data)
   ‚Üí Saves: database.py line 235 (add_expense)
   ‚Üí Redirects with flash message

Read in this order to understand complete flow.
```
