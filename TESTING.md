## Introduction to Software Testing

**What is Software Testing?**
Software testing is the process of verifying that a software application works as expected. It involves:
- Running the application with different inputs
- Checking that outputs match expectations
- Finding bugs before users do
- Ensuring the application handles errors gracefully

**Definition: Bug**
A bug (also called a defect or issue) is any behavior in the software that doesn't match the intended design or causes problems for users.

**Definition: Test Case**
A test case is a specific scenario you test, including:
- **Input:** What you enter or click
- **Expected Output:** What should happen
- **Actual Output:** What actually happens
- **Pass/Fail:** Whether they match

---

## Why Testing Matters

### For Users:
- **Prevents Frustration:** Users don't encounter errors that make them lose data
- **Builds Trust:** Reliable software means users trust your application
- **Better Experience:** Smooth, bug-free interactions keep users happy

### For Developers:
- **Catches Bugs Early:** Finding bugs during testing is cheaper than fixing them in production
- **Prevents Regression:** Ensures new changes don't break existing features
- **Documentation:** Tests serve as examples of how features should work
- **Confidence:** You can deploy knowing the application works

### Real-World Example:
Imagine a banking app that doesn't test for negative numbers. A user accidentally enters "-$1000" and the app subtracts money instead of adding it! Testing would catch this.

---

## Types of Testing

### 1. **Manual Testing** (What We're Doing)
**Definition:** A human manually uses the application and checks if it works.

**Pros:**
- No coding required
- Can catch UX issues
- Flexible and exploratory

**Cons:**
- Time-consuming
- Can miss edge cases
- Not repeatable automatically

**When to Use:** Always do manual testing first to understand how the app feels to use.

---

### 2. **Automated Testing** (Future Enhancement)
**Definition:** Code that tests other code automatically.

**Types:**
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions (e.g., test `calculate_total()` function)
- **Integration Tests:** Test multiple components together (e.g., database + routes)
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate real user interactions (e.g., fill form, click submit, check database)

**Example Unit Test (Python):**
```python
def test_add_expense():
    result = add_expense('2025-01-01', 'Food', 50.0, 'Lunch')
    assert result > 0  # Should return an ID
    assert isinstance(result, int)  # ID should be an integer
```

**When to Use:** After manual testing confirms features work, write automated tests to prevent regression.

---

### 3. **Functional Testing** (What We're Focusing On)
**Definition:** Testing that each feature works according to requirements.

**Our Features to Test:**
- ‚úÖ Add expense
- ‚úÖ Edit expense
- ‚úÖ Delete expense
- ‚úÖ View all expenses
- ‚úÖ Filter by category
- ‚úÖ Filter by date range
- ‚úÖ Export to CSV
- ‚úÖ View analytics charts
- ‚úÖ Manage budgets
- ‚úÖ View dashboard statistics

---

### 4. **Edge Case Testing**
**Definition:** Testing extreme, unusual, or boundary conditions.

**Examples:**
- What if amount is $0?
- What if amount is $999,999,999?
- What if amount is negative?
- What if description is 1000 characters?
- What if date is in the year 1900?
- What if date is in the future?
- What if user submits empty form?
- What if user enters text in number field?

**Why Important:** Most bugs hide at the edges, not in normal use cases.

---

### 5. **Usability Testing**
**Definition:** Testing if the application is easy and pleasant to use.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is it clear what each button does?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Is the layout intuitive?
- Does it work on mobile screens?
- Can keyboard-only users navigate?
- Are colors readable?

---

### 6. **Cross-Browser Testing**
**Definition:** Testing that the application works on different browsers.

**Browsers to Test:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- ‚úÖ Firefox
- ‚úÖ Safari (if on Mac)

**Why Important:** Different browsers render CSS and JavaScript slightly differently.

---

## Testing Tools & Environment

### Browser Developer Tools (DevTools)

**How to Open:**
- **Windows/Linux:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`

**Key Tabs:**

#### 1. **Console Tab**
**What It Shows:** JavaScript errors, warnings, and console.log() messages

**What to Look For:**
- ‚ùå **Red errors:** JavaScript broke, feature might not work
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow warnings:** Non-critical issues
- üîµ **Blue info:** Informational messages

**Example Error:**
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of null
    at main.js:45
```
This means JavaScript tried to access an element that doesn't exist.

---

#### 2. **Network Tab**
**What It Shows:** All HTTP requests (page loads, form submissions, API calls)

**What to Look For:**
- ‚úÖ **Status 200:** Request succeeded
- ‚ùå **Status 404:** File not found
- ‚ùå **Status 500:** Server error
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** How long requests take (slow = bad UX)

**How to Use:**
1. Open Network tab
2. Submit a form
3. See POST request to `/add`
4. Check status code (should be 200 or 302 redirect)
5. Check response (should not show error message)

---

#### 3. **Elements Tab**
**What It Shows:** HTML structure and CSS styles

**What to Look For:**
- Check if elements have correct classes
- Inspect CSS to see why styling looks wrong
- Verify form fields have correct `name` attributes

**How to Use:**
1. Right-click element
2. Choose "Inspect"
3. See HTML and CSS applied to that element

---

### Application Console (Terminal)

**What It Shows:** Flask server logs, Python errors, print statements

**What to Look For:**
```
127.0.0.1 - - [01/Oct/2025 12:34:56] "POST /add HTTP/1.1" 302 -
```
- IP address
- Timestamp
- HTTP method (POST)
- URL path (/add)
- Status code (302 = redirect, success!)

**Error Example:**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "app.py", line 123, in add_expense
    amount = float(request.form['amount'])
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'
```
This means someone entered text instead of a number.

---

### SQLite Database Viewer

**Option 1: DB Browser for SQLite (Recommended)**
- Free application: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
- Visual interface to see data
- Can run SQL queries manually

**Option 2: Python Script**
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('finance.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM expenses")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

**Why Important:** Verify data is actually saved correctly in database.

---

- [ ] Test with exactly 1 expense
- [ ] Test with 1000+ expenses (performance)

**Validation:**
- Check that calculations match manual calculation
- Verify currency formatting (always 2 decimals)

---

#### Test Case 1.2: Recent Expenses List
**Steps:**
1. Look at "Recent Expenses" section
2. Count number of expenses shown

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Shows maximum 5 most recent expenses
- ‚úÖ Sorted by date (newest first)
- ‚úÖ Each expense shows date, category, amount, description
- ‚úÖ "View All" button links to `/expenses`

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Test with 0 expenses (should show "No expenses yet" message)
- [ ] Test with exactly 5 expenses
- [ ] Test with 10 expenses (should still show only 5)

---

#### Test Case 1.3: Quick Actions Buttons
**Steps:**
1. Click "Add Expense" button
2. Verify redirects to `/add`
3. Go back
4. Click "View All Expenses" button
5. Verify redirects to `/expenses`

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Buttons are clearly visible

- ‚úÖ Correct URLs
- ‚úÖ Icons display properly

---

### Feature 2: Add Expense (add_expense.html)

#### Test Case 2.1: Valid Expense Submission
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/add`
2. Fill in form:
   - **Date:** 2025-10-01
   - **Category:** Food
   - **Amount:** 45.50
   - **Description:** Lunch at cafe
3. Click "Add Expense"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Success message appears: "Expense added successfully!"
- ‚úÖ Redirects to dashboard
- ‚úÖ New expense appears in Recent Expenses
- ‚úÖ Total Expenses increases by $45.50
- ‚úÖ Database contains new record

**Verification:**
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM expenses ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1`
- Verify all fields saved correctly
- Check `created_at` timestamp is accurate

---

#### Test Case 2.2: Empty Form Submission
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/add`
2. Leave all fields empty
3. Try to submit

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ HTML5 validation prevents submission
- ‚úÖ Browser shows "Please fill out this field" message
- ‚úÖ Red borders appear on empty required fields
- ‚úÖ No data saved to database

**Why This Matters:** Client-side validation prevents unnecessary server requests.

---

#### Test Case 2.3: Invalid Amount Values
**Test Data:**

| Input | Expected Behavior |
|-------|------------------|
| `-50.00` | Rejected: "Amount must be at least 0.01" |
| `0` | Rejected: "Amount must be at least 0.01" |
| `0.001` | Rejected: Browser rounds to 0.01 (step="0.01") |
| `abc` | Rejected: HTML5 prevents entering letters |
| `$45.50` | Rejected: Dollar sign not allowed in number field |
| `999999999` | Accepted (but might need max limit) |
| `` (empty) | Rejected: Required field |

**Steps for Each:**
1. Enter test value in Amount field
2. Try to submit form
3. Verify error message or rejection

**Edge Case Discovery:**
- ‚ùì Should we have a maximum amount? (e.g., $1,000,000)
- ‚ùì What about very precise amounts like $45.999? (gets rounded)

---

#### Test Case 2.4: Invalid Date Values
**Test Data:**

| Input | Expected Behavior |
|-------|------------------|
| `2025-10-01` | ‚úÖ Accepted (current date) |
| `2020-01-01` | ‚úÖ Accepted (past date) |
| `2030-01-01` | ‚ùì Should future dates be allowed? |
| `1900-01-01` | ‚úÖ Accepted but unusual |
| `` (empty) | ‚ùå Rejected: Required field |

**Edge Case to Consider:**
Should we prevent future dates? Many expense trackers do:
```javascript
// Could add to main.js
const dateInput = document.querySelector('input[type="date"]');
dateInput.max = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];  // Today's date
```

---

#### Test Case 2.5: Description Field Edge Cases
**Test Data:**

| Input | Expected Behavior |
|-------|------------------|
| `` (empty) | ‚úÖ Accepted (optional field) |
| `A` | ‚úÖ Accepted (1 character) |
| `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...` (500 chars) | ‚ùì Should have max length? |
| `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` | ‚úÖ Jinja2 auto-escapes, safe |
| `Caf√© na√Øve r√©sum√©` | ‚úÖ UTF-8 characters work |
| `üòÄüéâüí∞` | ‚úÖ Emojis should work |

**Security Test:**
1. Enter: `<b>Bold description</b>`
2. Submit and view in expense list
3. **Expected:** See literal text `<b>Bold description</b>` (not bold)
4. **Why:** Jinja2 auto-escapes HTML to prevent XSS attacks

**Definition: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
A security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious JavaScript into web pages. Auto-escaping prevents this.

---

#### Test Case 2.6: Category Dropdown
**Steps:**

---

#### Test Case 3.3: Filter by Date Range
**Steps:**
1. Enter Start Date: `2025-09-01`
2. Enter End Date: `2025-09-30`
3. Click "Apply Filters"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Only September expenses shown
- ‚úÖ Total updates correctly
- ‚úÖ URL updates: `/expenses?start_date=2025-09-01&end_date=2025-09-30`

**Why It Matters:** Low vision users need high contrast to read text.

**Our Colors:**
```css
/* Primary button */
background: #007bff;  /* Blue */
color: white;
/* Ratio: 8.59:1 ‚úÖ Passes */

/* Success button */
background: #28a745;  /* Green */
color: white;
/* Ratio: 4.53:1 ‚úÖ Passes */
```

from database import add_expense

categories = ['Food', 'Transport', 'Entertainment', 'Bills']
for i in range(1000):
    add_expense(
        date='2025-09-15',
        category=random.choice(categories),
        amount=round(random.uniform(5, 200), 2),
        description=f'Test expense {i}'
    )
```
2. Navigate to `/expenses`

**Attack Attempt:**
1. In description field, enter:
```
'; DROP TABLE expenses; --
```
2. Submit form

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Form submits normally
- ‚úÖ Description saved as literal text
- ‚úÖ Database NOT affected
- ‚úÖ No tables dropped

**Why It Works:**
```python
# BAD (vulnerable):
cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO expenses (description) VALUES ('{description}')")
# Becomes: INSERT INTO expenses (description) VALUES (''; DROP TABLE expenses; --')
# Executes TWO statements!

# GOOD (safe):
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO expenses (description) VALUES (?)", (description,))
# Database treats entire input as single string value
```

---

#### Test Case 12.2: XSS Prevention
**Attack Attempt:**
1. Enter description: `<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>`
2. Submit and view expense

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Alert does NOT pop up
- ‚úÖ Literal text displayed: `<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>`
- ‚úÖ HTML escaped: `&lt;script&gt;alert('Hacked!');&lt;/script&gt;`

**Why It Works:**
```html
<!-- Jinja2 auto-escapes by default -->
{{ expense.description }}
<!-- Becomes: -->
&lt;script&gt;alert('Hacked!');&lt;/script&gt;
<!-- Browser shows as text, doesn't execute -->
```

## Edge Cases Explained

### What Are Edge Cases?

**Definition:** Edge cases are unusual, extreme, or boundary conditions that might not be tested in normal use but can cause bugs.

**Example:**
- **Normal Case:** User enters $50 for lunch
- **Edge Case:** User enters $0.01 (minimum)
- **Edge Case:** User enters $999,999,999 (maximum)
- **Edge Case:** User enters negative number
- **Edge Case:** User leaves field empty

### Why Edge Cases Matter

**Real-World Example:**
In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter crashed because one team used metric units and another used imperial. An edge case (unit mismatch) cost $327 million!

**In Our App:**
- If we don't test empty database, app might crash on first launch
- If we don't test long descriptions, text might overflow containers
- If we don't test future dates, users might accidentally track future expenses

### Common Edge Cases to Test

#### 1. **Empty States**
- Database with 0 expenses
- Form with all fields empty
- Filter that returns 0 results
- Category with no expenses

#### 2. **Boundary Values**
- Minimum: $0.01
- Maximum: $999,999,999
- Exactly 0
- Exactly 1
- Very large numbers

#### 3. **Data Type Mismatches**
- Text in number field
- Numbers in text field
- Special characters: `!@#$%^&*()`
- Unicode: `emoji, ‰∏≠Êñá, ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©`

#### 4. **Time-Based Edge Cases**
- First day of month
- Last day of month
- Leap year (Feb 29)
- Daylight saving time transitions
- Year 2038 problem (32-bit timestamp overflow)

#### 5. **Length Extremes**
- 1-character input
- 1000-character input
- Empty string
- Just whitespace: `"   "`

### Example Bug Report

```markdown
## Bug #002 - Negative Amounts Accepted in Expense Form

**Status:** üü¢ Fixed

**Severity:** High

**Date Reported:** 2025-10-01

### Description
Users can enter negative amounts (e.g., -$50) in the expense form, which creates nonsensical data.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to `/add`
2. Enter amount: `-50.00`
3. Fill other fields
4. Click "Add Expense"
5. Form submits successfully

### Expected Behavior
Form should reject negative amounts and show error: "Amount must be positive"

### Actual Behavior
Negative amount accepted and saved to database

### Root Cause
HTML number input has no `min` attribute:
```html
<input type="number" name="amount" step="0.01">
```

### Solution
Added `min="0.01"` attribute:
```html
<input type="number" name="amount" step="0.01" min="0.01" required>
```

Also added server-side validation in app.py:
```python
amount = float(request.form['amount'])
if amount <= 0:
    flash('Amount must be positive', 'error')
    return redirect(url_for('add_expense'))
```

### Testing
- [x] Verified HTML5 validation prevents negative input
- [x] Tested with 0, -0.01, -100
- [x] Server-side validation catches direct POST requests
- [x] Existing positive amounts still work

### Prevention
Always validate on both client (UX) and server (security) sides.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Always Test on Real Data**
- Don't just test with perfect inputs
- Use realistic data: typos, varied lengths, special characters
- Test with your own expenses for 1-2 weeks

### 2. **Test Early and Often**
- Don't wait until the end to test
- Test each feature as you build it
- Fix bugs immediately (cheaper than later)

### 3. **Automate Repetitive Tests**
- If you test the same thing 5+ times, write a script
- Example: Script to add 100 random expenses for testing

### 4. **Test in Multiple Environments**
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Different OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Different screen sizes
- With and without internet (if applicable)

### 5. **Use Version Control**
- Commit working code before making changes
- If tests fail after changes, you can revert

### 6. **Document Everything**
- Write down steps to reproduce bugs
- Keep test cases up to date
- Update documentation when features change

### 7. **Think Like a User**
- Users don't read instructions
- Users make typos
- Users click things twice
- Users use the app in unexpected ways

### 8. **Test Error Handling**
- What if database is locked?
- What if database file deleted?
- What if server runs out of disk space?
- What if internet connection drops mid-request?

---

## Testing Schedule

### During Development (Continuous)
- Test each feature as you build it
- Quick smoke test after every significant change

### Before Demo/Release (Comprehensive)
- Full checklist (all test cases above)

## Conclusion

Testing is not about finding zero bugs (impossible). Testing is about:
- **Understanding** your application's behavior
- **Finding** the most critical bugs before users do
- **Building confidence** that core features work
- **Learning** how users will actually use your app

> "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs." - Edsger Dijkstra

Good luck with testing! Remember: every bug you find is a bug your users won't encounter. üêõ ‚Üí ‚úÖ
